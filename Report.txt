Implementation of Cross-over, Mutation, and Selection

In the genetic algorithm implemented for image regeneration, the three key genetic operations – cross-over, mutation, and selection – play a crucial role in driving the evolutionary process and guiding the population towards the target image.

Cross-over

Cross-over is the primary mechanism for exchanging genetic information between individuals in the population. The algorithm employs two cross-over techniques:

Slice cross-over: This method randomly selects a crossover point within the DNA sequence and exchanges the genetic material between the parent chromosomes at that point.

Random cross-over: In this approach, the DNA sequence is divided into individual genes, and each gene is randomly inherited from either parent.

The choice of cross-over technique can influence the algorithm's performance and exploration of the search space. Slice cross-over preserves larger chunks of parental information, while random cross-over promotes more thorough mixing of genetic material.

Mutation

Mutation introduces random changes to the genetic material, preventing stagnation and allowing for exploration of new solutions. The algorithm implements a simple mutation strategy:

With a specified probability, a randomly selected gene is replaced with a new random value.
The mutation rate is a critical parameter that balances exploration and exploitation. A high mutation rate can lead to rapid divergence from promising solutions, while a low mutation rate may hinder the algorithm's ability to escape local optima.

Selection

Selection determines which individuals from the current population will contribute their genetic material to the next generation. The algorithm employs a fitness-proportional selection scheme:

Each individual's fitness score is calculated based on its similarity to the target image.

A probability distribution is constructed based on the relative fitness scores of the individuals.

Parents for the next generation are selected probabilistically using roulette wheel selection.

This selection method prioritizes individuals with higher fitness scores, ensuring that the genetic material from better solutions is more likely to be passed on to the next generation.

The interplay of cross-over, mutation, and selection drives the genetic algorithm's search for an optimal solution. Cross-over and mutation introduce new genetic combinations, while selection guides the population towards fitter solutions. By carefully balancing these operations, the algorithm can effectively explore the search space and converge towards the desired image representation.
